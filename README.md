Automatic Fence Lighting Circuit with Alarm

An automatic fence lighting circuit with an alarm is designed to boost security by turning on lights and sounding an alarm when it detects motion near the fence. This system helps to scare off intruders and makes the area more visible at night. It combines motion sensors with bright lights and an alarm system, all controlled by a central unit. This setup is perfect for keeping homes and businesses safe, especially in dark or secluded areas.
